## About

### The George H. W. Bush Composite Squadron

In early 2009, a remote flight of the Lone Star Composite Squadron, located in Brenham, Texas, was formed in College Station. Asked to decide on a name for the squadron, the members decided on “George H. W. Bush”. The members wrote to the former President asking for his sponsorship, to which he agreed “with pleasure.”

Shortly after noon on 31 March 2009 in a ceremony at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, former President George H. W. Bush presented its Civil Air Patrol charter to the George H. W. Bush Composite Squadron (SWR-TX-041).

Today, the George Bush Composite Squadron is one of the fastest growing squadrons in Texas Wing; our membership consists of cadets ranging from 12 to 20 years of age, and senior members 18 years of age and up. Our members have the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of pursuits fulfilling the three missions of CAP.

### Civil Air Patrol

Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a Congressionally chartered, federally supported, non-profit corporation that serves as the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force (USAF). CAP is a volunteer organization with an aviation-minded membership that includes people from all backgrounds, lifestyles, and occupations. It performs three congressionally assigned key missions: emergency services, which includes search and rescue (by air and ground), disaster relief, and homeland security operations; aerospace education for youth and the general public; and cadet programs for teenage youth. CAP also performs non-auxiliary missions for various governmental and private agencies, such as local law enforcement and the American Red Cross.

Nationwide, CAP is a major operator of single-engine general aviation aircraft, used in the execution of our various missions, including orientation flights for cadets and the provision of significant emergency services capabilities. Because of these extensive flying opportunities, many CAP members become licensed pilots.
