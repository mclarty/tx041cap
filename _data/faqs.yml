    You can join CAP as a cadet if you are at least 12 years old and before your 19th 
    birthday. Cadets can stay in the program until they turn 21 as long as they have 
    not entered active duty and are enrolled in a school.

  answer: >
    No, you do not have to join the military, but many choose to do so. Cadets who 
    earn the Billy Mitchell Award may enter the Air Force at an advanced grade (E-3) 
    if they choose to enlist. The service academies and ROTC also look favorably on 
    CAP experience. Approximately 10% of the USAF Academy cadet corps got their start 
    in CAP. But no matter what career you choose, the skills you learn in CAP will be 
    invaluable.
