- question: Is prior military experience counted?
  answer: >
    Regular and Reserve officers of the Armed Forces of the United States, active, retired, 
    or honorably discharged, may be advanced to a CAP grade equivalent to their grade in the 
    Armed Forces (but not to exceed lieutenant colonel), in recognition of their military 
    knowledge and experience.  

    Regular, Reserve, and National Guard Senior Noncommissioned Officers of the Armed Forces or 
    Coast Guard of the United States, active, or retired, may receive an advanced CAP grade in 
    recognition of their military knowledge and experience.  

    Such promotions are neither automatic nor mandatory, but are at the discretion of the promoting 
    authority.

- question: Do I have to wear a uniform?
  answer: >
    Senior members may be required to wear a uniform during some activities – such as when flying in 
    CAP aircraft or working with the cadet program. Senior members may wear the USAF style blue uniform

    To be eligible to fly a corporate aircraft, the pilot must possess a valid FAA private, commercial or 
    airline pilot certificate; must be an active CAP member at least 17 years in age; and must possess a 
    valid and current medical certificate. The member must complete a flight check in the aircraft within 
    the preceding 12 months as well as an annual written examination and annual aircraft questionnaires for

- question: Will CAP train me to be a pilot?
  answer: >
    CAP does not normally provide primary flight training for members. That said, we do have a lot of members 
    who are also Certified Flight Instructors and often willing to provide training to members at reduced rates. 
    Depending on your locality, CAP members may also have access to military aero clubs and their flight instructors 
    which can be significantly cheaper than going through a normal commercial operation. We have several scholarships 
    that help CAP Cadets obtain a pilot’s license. See our scholarships page for details. Once you have your license, 
    you can fly with CAP CFIs in CAP aircraft to increase your ratings which can also be significantly cheaper than a 
    commercial operation.

- question: How do senior members advance in the progam and earn promotions?
  answer: >
    All promotions are at the discretion of your squadron commander, but the standard way to earn rank is determined by 
    your time in CAP, time in your current rank, and the training you complete for your CAP position. There are other 
    circumstances that warrant a promotion – for specifics, talk to your squadron commander.

- question: I’ve been arrested/charged before; can I still be a member?
  answer: >
    Having an arrest/conviction (or other similar charges) does not automatically preclude you from membership. We can not make 
    a determination until after you apply for membership in CAP. Just make sure that you note the charges on the application and 
    supply any required information. Once the application comes to National Headquarters the Confidential Screening Coordinator 
    will review your case.

- question: How old do cadets have to be to join?
  answer: >
    You can join CAP as a cadet if you are at least 12 years old and before your 19th 
    birthday. Cadets can stay in the program until they turn 21 as long as they have 
    not entered active duty and are enrolled in a school.

- question: Are cadets expected to join the military?
  answer: >
    No, you do not have to join the military, but many choose to do so. Cadets who 
    earn the Billy Mitchell Award may enter the Air Force at an advanced grade (E-3) 
    if they choose to enlist. The service academies and ROTC also look favorably on 
    CAP experience. Approximately 10% of the USAF Academy cadet corps got their start 
    in CAP. But no matter what career you choose, the skills you learn in CAP will be 
    invaluable.

- question: How much time do cadets have to give each week?
  answer: >
    To get the most out of the cadet program you should participate regularly. Like any other activity, 
    you’ll get out of CAP only what you put into it. Most squadrons meet weekly for about 2 1/2 hours, 
    and offer special activities on the weekends and during the summer.

- question: Can cadets learn how to fly?
  answer: >
    You will have the opportunity to fly in a CAP plane and possibly a military aircraft. CAP doesn't 
    teach all cadets to fly, but provides opportunities such as flight academies during the summer 
    which provide cadets with ground school training and a limited number of flying hours. You can also 
    compete for scholarships that will help pay for your pilot's license.

    - Parents
- question: Who leads and supervises the cadets?
  answer: >
    CAP takes its responsibility to safeguard youth very seriously. The adult volunteers who interact 
    with cadets (known as CAP senior members) have been fingerprinted and screened by the FBI. All 
    adult members also take a Cadet Protection course as part of their initial training.
  category:
    - Parents
- question: Do cadets need to maintain a certain grade point average to participate in CAP?
  answer: >
    School should always come first for the cadets. CAP expects cadets to maintain "satisfactory performance" 
    at school, as defined by the cadet's parents. Because CAP emphasizes self-discipline, it's not uncommon 
    for parents to see their son's or daughter's grades increase as a result of their participation in the 
    Cadet Program.
  category:
    - Parents
- question: Why do cadets wear uniforms?
  answer: >
    CAP uses uniforms to promote teamwork and develop self-discipline. The uniform motivates cadets to set 
    high standards for themselves and to live their core values of integrity, volunteer service, excellence, 
    and respect. Additionally, cadets practice military customs and courtesies as part of their leadership 
    training.
  category:
    - Parents
- question: What uniforms do cadets wear?
  answer: >
    The basic cadet uniform is the short-sleeve Air Force style blue uniform. Most cadets also choose to wear 
    the optional ABU or BDU (camouflage) uniform.
  category:
    - Parents
- question: How do cadets obtain uniforms?
  answer: >
    New cadets are eligible to receive the Air Force style blue uniform at no cost to them through the Cadet 
    Uniform Program, depending on the availability of Air Force funding. See your local squadron commander 
    for details. ABUs, BDUs and other uniform items may be available through your squadron, but most of the 
    time you will need to purchase the items through the CAP uniform store or they may be purchased through 
    the clothing sales store on military installations.

- question: What’s involved with cadet orientation flights?
  answer: >
    Through orientation flights in powered aircraft and gliders, cadets experience flight first-hand. CAP's 
    pilots are licensed by the FAA, follow a syllabus for each flight, and ensure the flight is conducted 
    safely. Orientation flights are free to cadets. See the squadron commander for information about when 
    the next opportunity to fly is scheduled.
  category:
    - Parents
- question: How do cadets advance and earn promotions?
  answer: >
    Cadets advance at their own pace through self-study and group study. To progress, cadets must (1) participate 
    actively; (2) pass a written leadership test; (3) pass a written aerospace test; (4) pass a physical fitness 
    test; (5) participate in character development forums; and most of all (6) demonstrate they have the maturity 
    to accept increased responsibility. (In some stages of the Cadet Program, these requirements differ slightly.)

- question: Can I be involved in CAP with my teen?
  answer: >
    Absolutely! Some opportunities to share in the CAP experience are:  

    **Cadet Sponsor Member** — Just like any other youth organization, CAP relies on parents to help support the 
    program. Parents do have to undergo the same background screening process and cadet protection training as the 
    other adult members and first year dues are just $30 and renewals are only $20. As a parent sponsor, you'll be 
    able to help chaperone the cadets, ride or drive in the CAP vehicles, and otherwise help the other adult volunteer 
    members. You will not be required to wear the Air Force-style uniform.  

    **Senior Member** — If you are more interested in taking a leadership role in the Cadet Program, or want to participate 
    in CAP's aerospace education and emergency services missions, you should join as a senior member. Talk with your child's 
    squadron commander about joining as a senior member. You will need to submit and complete a membership application, 
    fingerprint card and complete an orientation course. Annual membership dues vary. Please
